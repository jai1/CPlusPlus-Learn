	// Inheritance guidelines:-
	// a. Multiple inheritance - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7APovvvftQs&index=5&list=WL
	//    In short use java approach - inherit only one class and multiple interfaces (Pure abstract classes)
	//    Keep interfaces as short and concise as possible s
	// b. Don't use inheritance for code re use, use composition instead, i.e if two classes have similar functions
	//    don't inherit one from other, just transfer the functions to a separate helper class and give both the classes
	//    an object of the helper class.
	// c. Minimize base class implementation
	// d. Minimize level of hierarchies
	// e. Inheritance breaks encapsulation. (since a child can access parents protected members)

	// Koenig Lookup - Argument Dependent Lookup for namespaces only - not applicable to classses

//	/* Return type rules for overriding
//	Overriding essentially means that either the Base class method or the Derived class method will be called at run-time depending on the actual object pointed by the pointer.
//	It implies that:
//	i.e: Every place where the Base class method can be called can be replaced by call to Derived class method without any change to calling code.
//
//	In order to achieve this the only possible way is to restrict the return types of the overriding virtual methods to return the same type as the Base class or a type derived from that(co-variant return types) and the Standard enforces this condition.

	Vehicle *v = new Car(10000);
	// If the vehicle didn't have a virtual destructor then
	// the cars destructor will not be called
	delete v;

	// Virtual is inherited hence if we created a class CustomCars
	// which inherits Cars did a (new CustomCars), base class pointer
	// would still call derived class functions eventhough Cars doesn't
	// define functions as virtual (since Vehicle - Car's base) has defined them virtual.
	// This works for all virtual functions (which includes destructors)

	// Deciding if I need a virtual destructor when creating base class?
	// A. If any of my functions are virtual, you need to define the destructor as virtual

	// C++11
	// shared_ptr can call the derived class functions and destructors w/o using virtual
	// This is only true for shared_ptr, doesn't apply to unique or scoped ptr
	// STL don't have virtual function hence if you decide to derive an STL class, use
	// a shared_ptr.
